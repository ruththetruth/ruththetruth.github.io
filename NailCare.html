<li>
<p><em>Be sure to wash your hands often, and if your nails are long be sure to wash under them.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>try not to use harsh chemicals when taking off your nail polish (Non-Acetone removers are less agressive than regular Acetone)</em></p>
</li>
<li><em>Use moisturizer</em></li>
<li><em>Watch what you eat</em></li>
<li>Maybe give your nails a break from polish every now and then. It allows them to breath.</li>
